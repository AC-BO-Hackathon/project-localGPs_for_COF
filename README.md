Project 39 : Divide and Conquer : Local Gaussian Processes to design Covalent Organic Frameworks for Methane Deliverable Capacity
----------------

In this project, we explore the use of local 
Gaussian Process models to accelerate materials 
discovery when the search spaces are very large. 
We evaluate the performance of the framework on a 
covalent organic framework (COF) dataset that consists 
of 69,840 2D and 3D COFs [1]. This dataset replicates 
some real-world scenarios wherein the search space 
to explore is very large. In this test, we used an
initial training dataset of 680 points, i.e 10\% of 
the total search space. These COF structures are 
designed for methane storage and our optimization
target here is the deliverable capacity 
(v STP/v) of the COF structure.
